### **Basic Usage**

+ First of all, it is necessary to configure the environment. I strongly recommend the use of virtual environments with conda. 
Above there is an example creating and activating a conda virtual environment.

```
	conda create -n text_mining python=3.8
	conda activate text_mining
```

+ Install the dependencies:

```
	make deps
```
